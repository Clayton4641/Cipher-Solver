# Cipher-Solver

A program to solve simple random ciphers. The tool is written in Java and is multi-threaded for higher performance. The main solving algorithm takes a BFS like approach and uses a dictionary to determine valid word mappings.

Note: If a word in the cipher is missing from the dictionary the cipher will not be solved.
